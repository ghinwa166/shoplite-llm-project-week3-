## Document 1: User Registration and Account Management

Shoplite offers a streamlined registration process for both buyers and sellers. To create an account, users visit the Shoplite homepage and click on the “Sign Up” button. They must provide their full name, email address, and a secure password. After submitting the form, users receive an email confirmation with a link to verify their account. Verification must be completed within 24 hours, or the account creation will be invalidated.

Once registered, users can access their account dashboard, where they can update personal details such as shipping addresses, contact information, and password settings. Shoplite encourages users to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for added account security.

For sellers, additional verification is required. They must submit business details, including a tax identification number (TIN), legal business name, and banking information for payouts. Seller accounts undergo manual review, which typically takes 2–3 business days. Upon approval, sellers gain access to inventory management, analytics, and order processing tools.

Account management includes features such as order history viewing, wishlist tracking, saved payment methods, and communication with customer support. Users can also deactivate or permanently delete their accounts through the "Account Settings" section. 

Password recovery is available through the “Forgot Password” link and requires email verification to reset credentials securely.

## Document 2: Product Search and Filtering Features

Shoplite provides powerful product search and filtering tools to help users quickly find what they need. At the top of every page is a global search bar that accepts keywords, product names, brands, or categories. Search results are ranked based on relevance, popularity, and customer ratings.

Users can narrow results using a robust set of filters, including price range, brand, seller location, shipping time, ratings, stock availability, and product condition (new or used). Filters dynamically update results without requiring a page reload, offering a smooth and efficient browsing experience.

In addition to filters, users can sort results by price (low to high, or high to low), newest arrivals, and best-selling products. A “Smart Suggestions” feature offers real-time auto-complete recommendations based on trending searches and user behavior.

Category pages offer further refinement by showing subcategories, related tags, and top-rated products. Users browsing mobile devices enjoy the same functionality, with filters accessible via a collapsible menu.

Shoplite also supports advanced search queries, allowing users to combine keywords with Boolean operators (e.g., “headphones AND wireless”) to produce more accurate results. All filtering and sorting preferences are retained in the user's session and can be saved for future use.

Overall, Shoplite’s search system is designed to reduce friction, improve discoverability, and help users make faster, informed shopping decisions.

## Document 3: Shopping Cart and Checkout Process

The Shoplite shopping cart provides a user-friendly experience for managing items before purchase. Users can add multiple products from different sellers, adjust quantities, and apply promotional codes—all from a centralized cart interface. The cart is accessible at all times via the icon in the site header.

Each item in the cart displays its price, estimated shipping time, seller name, and availability status. Users can remove items, move them to a "Save for Later" list, or compare alternatives directly within the cart view. Items are automatically saved to the user's account, ensuring persistence across devices and sessions.

When users are ready to check out, Shoplite initiates a secure multi-step process. First, users confirm shipping addresses and select a delivery method. Next, they choose a payment option from saved cards, Shoplite Wallet, PayPal, or other supported gateways. Real-time inventory and discount validation ensures that only in-stock items proceed to payment.

Promotional codes can be entered during checkout and are validated instantly. Taxes and shipping costs are calculated automatically based on location and seller policies.

The final order summary is presented for confirmation before payment is processed. Once completed, users receive an order confirmation email and can track their order via the “My Orders” dashboard. The entire checkout process is optimized for speed, security, and mobile compatibility.

## Document 4: Payment Methods and Security

Shoplite gives customers many safe ways to pay for their orders. During checkout, users can choose from credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, Shoplite Wallet, or cash-on-delivery (if available in their country). Shoplite also supports digital payment apps like Apple Pay or Google Pay on mobile devices.

To keep payments secure, Shoplite uses trusted payment gateways that follow international security standards like PCI-DSS. This means all card information is encrypted and protected. Shoplite never stores your full card details.

Users can save payment methods in their account for faster checkout. These saved methods are protected with two-factor authentication (2FA) and can only be changed after email or phone verification.

For extra safety, Shoplite checks every order for fraud. If something looks suspicious, the system might pause the order and ask the user to verify their identity. This helps protect both buyers and sellers from fake transactions.

Shoplite Wallet allows users to store funds, get refunds faster, and apply cashback. It can be recharged using regular payment methods and is very helpful for regular customers.

Overall, Shoplite makes sure that all payments are quick, easy, and fully protected, whether you're shopping on desktop or mobile.

## Document 5: Order Tracking and Delivery

After placing an order on Shoplite, customers can track their package step-by-step. Once the order is confirmed, users get a tracking number by email and in the “My Orders” section of their account.

Shoplite partners with different delivery services depending on the country or region. Each shipment gets a tracking link that shows the delivery status in real-time — like “Order confirmed,” “Shipped,” “Out for delivery,” and “Delivered.” Customers also get updates by email or SMS at each step.

Estimated delivery dates are shown before you complete your order. These dates are based on the seller's location, shipping method, and the customer's address. Some sellers offer fast shipping or same-day delivery in certain cities.

If there’s a delay, users can contact customer support, who will speak to the seller or delivery company. In some cases, users may be offered a refund or store credit if the delay is too long.

Shoplite also supports multiple shipments. So, if you order from different sellers, you might receive items in separate packages at different times. Each one will have its own tracking number.

With real-time updates and clear delivery steps, Shoplite helps users stay informed and feel secure while waiting for their orders.

## Document 6: Return and Refund Policies

Shoplite wants every customer to be happy with their order. If something goes wrong, users can request a return or refund easily through the “My Orders” page. Most products can be returned within 30 days after delivery.

To start a return, customers click on “Return Item,” choose a reason (like damaged product, wrong item, or not satisfied), and upload a photo if needed. Shoplite reviews the request and sends a return label if it's approved.

Some items — like perishable goods or personal care products — may not be eligible for return, depending on the seller’s policy. These rules are always shown on the product page before you buy.

Once the returned item is received and checked by the seller, a refund is issued. Refunds go back to the original payment method or to the Shoplite Wallet. Wallet refunds are usually faster.

If a customer receives a damaged item or something they didn’t order, they are fully protected by Shoplite’s Buyer Protection Policy. In these cases, Shoplite may issue an instant refund without needing the item back.

Refund status can be tracked in the account, and support is available 24/7 if any problem happens.

Shoplite’s return and refund system is designed to be simple, fair, and fast, so customers can shop with confidence.

## Document 7: Product Reviews and Ratings

Shoplite allows customers to leave reviews and ratings after they receive their products. This helps other shoppers decide if a product is good and helps sellers improve their services.

Each product has a star rating from 1 to 5, based on customer reviews. Five stars means the customer was very happy, and one star means they had a bad experience. The average rating is shown on the product page, along with the number of total reviews.

Customers can also write a short comment to explain their rating. They may mention things like product quality, delivery speed, packaging, or customer service. They can also upload photos of the product they received.

To leave a review, customers must be logged in and must have purchased the product. This helps keep reviews honest and prevents fake feedback.

Sellers can reply to reviews to thank customers or respond to complaints. This creates trust between buyers and sellers. Negative reviews are not removed unless they break Shoplite’s review rules, like using offensive language or false claims.

Shoplite uses reviews to highlight top-rated products and sellers. Highly rated items may appear higher in search results or be featured in promotions.

In short, Shoplite’s review system helps create a fair and open shopping experience for everyone.

## Document 8: Seller Account Setup and Management

To become a seller on Shoplite, users need to create a seller account. This is different from a regular buyer account. First, go to the “Sell on Shoplite” page and click “Register as Seller.”

The seller must enter business details such as their store name, tax ID (if required in their country), and a valid bank account for receiving payments. They also need to upload some documents like a business license or national ID, depending on local rules.

After submitting the form, Shoplite reviews the information. This usually takes 2–3 business days. If approved, the seller gets access to the Seller Dashboard — a special area where they can add products, manage orders, and see their earnings.

In the Seller Dashboard, sellers can:
- Add product titles, photos, and descriptions
- Set prices and stock levels
- View orders and track shipping
- Communicate with customers
- See reports on sales and performance

Sellers are responsible for handling shipping, returns, and customer questions. Shoplite provides support if sellers need help or have problems with customers.

To keep selling, sellers must follow Shoplite’s rules about delivery times, product quality, and communication. Breaking the rules may lead to warnings or account suspension.

Selling on Shoplite is a great way for businesses to grow online and reach more customers.

## Document 9: Inventory Management for Sellers

Inventory management on Shoplite helps sellers keep track of their products, stock levels, and availability. It’s very important to update your inventory often so customers don’t buy something that’s out of stock.

Inside the Seller Dashboard, there’s a section called “Inventory.” Here, sellers can:
- Add new products with titles, images, prices, and descriptions
- Set the available quantity for each product
- Mark products as out-of-stock when needed
- Update stock after new items arrive

Sellers can choose if a product is “in stock,” “low stock,” or “out of stock.” Shoplite can also send automatic reminders when stock is running low, so the seller can restock in time.

If a product is sold out but the seller doesn’t update the system, it can lead to cancellations and bad reviews. Shoplite tracks seller performance, so keeping inventory up to date helps maintain a good reputation.

For sellers with many products, Shoplite offers bulk upload tools using CSV files. This saves time and makes it easier to update many items at once.

Good inventory management also helps sellers plan promotions, avoid delays, and make better decisions based on what sells best.

Shoplite gives sellers the tools to manage their online store efficiently and provide a smooth shopping experience for customers.

## Document 10: Commission and Fee Structure

Shoplite earns money by charging sellers certain fees for using the platform. This helps Shoplite provide services like marketing, secure payments, and customer support. Sellers should understand the commission and fee structure before they start selling.

**Listing Fees:**  
Currently, Shoplite does not charge any fee to list products. Sellers can add as many items as they want for free.

When customers pay by card or digital wallet, a small payment processing fee is deducted. This fee usually ranges between 1.5% to 2% per transaction.

**Other Charges:**  
Optional services like featured listings, ads, or faster payouts may have extra fees. These services are optional and charged only if the seller chooses them.
